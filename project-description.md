Full Stack Project 2020 - A time management tool for serious musicians

App to help serious musicians organize and optimize their practice time.

Core features:

-Keep track of time used for practicing
-Keep notes for each practice session

Base level:

-Keep track of things/areas practiced, and give suggestions if needed based on previous practice sessions
-Give suggestions on how to organize practice time, encourage balanced sessions, notify if too much time is used on a given subject
-Set goals (day/month/year) on practice times (total time + individual areas), record progress and notify if goals are not met.
-Summarize things practiced, time spent, goals met/not met.
-A simple login system with a DB keeping track of your data

MAYBE: A simple metronome included. Nothing fancy, but maybe suggestions to get TimeGuru, Metronomics. Possible future integration?

Next level:

-A collection of suggested practice IDEAS based on skill level and chosen style/genre or general concepts like time, sound. 
	-For jazz, this could be specific scales, concepts, or specific songs/repertoire. E.g major 7 arpeggios, Coltrane changes, songs by Monk or Shorter. Either general or specific (‘practice Satellite for 30 min at 40bpm improvising only with the notes of the 7th chords’)
	-For classical, this would prob be more general suggestions on repertoire.
	-General non-genre ideas would include exercises on playing in time, polyrhythms, playing different scales or developing a good sound on your instrument.

NOTE: If a future teacher/student integration happens, a teacher could add any suggested topics for their students, and see how much time they spend on them.

-If suffering from a lack of motivation, the app can suggest a (random?) video on YouTube/web to give inspiration. This could be anything from a live performance to an instruction video. For this there would be genre-specific playlists overseen by administration. User could also add their favorite videos to a list to come back for inspiration. Initially this could be a link to outside service, but in the future these materials should be embedded.

Next level:

-An option to follow/connect with other users, see their progress (if allowed) and suggest materials. A teacher can create an account to follow their students progress, suggest areas of practice to them and see if they are spending enough time on different areas of study. Peers can follow each other for motivation and “friendly” competition on practice hours.

Future ideas:

-A library of actual practice materials - transcriptions, pdfs of exercises instructional videos, excerpts of method books etc. Copyright issues are obvious, but this could be an interesting way to collaborate with youtubers for example. Might have to be extra charge for the student with a profit split with the creator and the platform.

-Integration with iRealBook for mobile platforms.

NOTES: This app would NOT record your playing or give any kind of feedback on it. It is entirely up to the students to hold themselves accountable and truthful. The app is meant for serious students who mostly know what they need to practice but need motivation and suggestions at times. This is NOT an app to learn an instrument, and the educational materials perhaps provided are not meant to be the only source of information for the student.
